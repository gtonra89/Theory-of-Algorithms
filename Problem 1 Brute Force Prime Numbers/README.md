Racket is a general purpose, multi-paradigm programming language in the Lisp-Scheme family. One of its design goals is to serve as a platform for language creation, design, and implementation.

## Instructions
The following exercises should be completed in the Racket programming language [1].
Remember to plan your work and make regular commits to your repository. The instructions
for submitting your work are given on the Moodle page. Note that “from scratch”
means using only cons, car, cdr, define, lambda, if, null, null?, cond, = and the
basic numerical operators (+, -, *, /, modulo). Other basic functions may be allowed,
but please confirm their use with the lecturer

## Brute Force Algorithm
In computer science, brute-force search or exhaustive search, also known as generate and test, is a very general problem-solving technique that consists of systematically enumerating all possible candidates for the solution and checking whether each candidate satisfies the problem's statement.

## Problem 1
1. Write, from scratch, a function in Racket that uses a brute-force algorithm that takes
a single positive integer and return true if the number is a prime and false otherwise.
Call the function decide-prime.
