Racket is a general purpose, multi-paradigm programming language in the Lisp-Scheme family. One of its design goals is to serve as a platform for language creation, design, and implementation.

## Functional Progrmamming

Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.

## Imperative programming?

Imperative programming is the most dominant paradigm with languages such as Java, C, C++, Python, Ruby and many more. It uses statements that change a program's state. It is characteristic of a sequence of steps/instructions that happen in order. Common constructs to manipulate the flow of these instructions include while statements and for loops. Variables are used to keep track of everything computed and which state the program is at which then can control where the program should go to next which continues to modify the state. The sequence of state changes is often called a side effect. The reason it is called a side effect is because it has the potential to modify the state, thus changing the flow of the program.

## DrRacket IDE
DrRacket (formerly DrScheme) is widely used among introductory Computer Science courses that teach Scheme or Racket and is lauded for its simplicity and appeal to beginner programmers. The IDE was originally built for use with the TeachScheme! project (now ProgramByDesign), an outreach effort Northeastern University and a number of affiliated universities for attracting high school students to computer science courses at the college level.

The editor provides source highlighting for syntax and run-time errors, parenthesis matching, a debugger and an algebraic stepper. Its student-friendly features include support for multiple "language levels" (Beginning Student, Intermediate Student and so on). It also has integrated library support, and sophisticated analysis tools for advanced programmers. In addition, module-oriented programming is supported with the module browser, a contour view, integrated testing and coverage measurements, and refactoring support. It provides integrated, context-sensitive access to an extensive hyper-linked help system named "Help Desk".

DrRacket is available for Windows (95 and up), Mac OS X, Unix, and Linux with the X Window System and programs behave similarly on all these platforms.

## How to Run
To run the labs or problems sheets copy my repositry<br>
download the DrRackket IDE from the link below<br>
https://download.racket-lang.org/<br>

After you installed follow these steps<br>

1. Clone this Repositry down and unzip the folder.<br>
2. Launch Dr Racket.<br> 
3. Down on the bottom of IDE select Language i am using RACKET eg rkt files.<br>
4. from the DR Racket Menu click "file then open" - proceed to the file location of the unzipped folder and choose which .rkt file you would like to Run
5. The file will load into Dr Racket IDE and you simply click on the run button in the Dr Racket IDE 


## Instructions
The following exercises should be completed in the Racket programming language [1].
Remember to plan your work and make regular commits to your repository. The instructions
for submitting your work are given on the Moodle page. Note that “from scratch”
means using only cons, car, cdr, define, lambda, if, null, null?, cond, = and the
basic numerical operators (+, -, *, /, modulo). Other basic functions may be allowed,
but please confirm their use with the lecturer
