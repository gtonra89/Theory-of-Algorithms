Racket is a general purpose, multi-paradigm programming language in the Lisp-Scheme family. One of its design goals is to serve as a platform for language creation, design, and implementation.

## DrRacket IDE
DrRacket (formerly DrScheme) is widely used among introductory Computer Science courses that teach Scheme or Racket and is lauded for its simplicity and appeal to beginner programmers. The IDE was originally built for use with the TeachScheme! project (now ProgramByDesign), an outreach effort Northeastern University and a number of affiliated universities for attracting high school students to computer science courses at the college level.

The editor provides source highlighting for syntax and run-time errors, parenthesis matching, a debugger and an algebraic stepper. Its student-friendly features include support for multiple "language levels" (Beginning Student, Intermediate Student and so on). It also has integrated library support, and sophisticated analysis tools for advanced programmers. In addition, module-oriented programming is supported with the module browser, a contour view, integrated testing and coverage measurements, and refactoring support. It provides integrated, context-sensitive access to an extensive hyper-linked help system named "Help Desk".

DrRacket is available for Windows (95 and up), Mac OS X, Unix, and Linux with the X Window System and programs behave similarly on all these platforms.

## How to Run
To run the labs or problems sheets copy my repositry<br>
download the DrRackket IDE from the link below<br>

https://download.racket-lang.org/<br>
After you installed follow these steps<br>

Down on bottom of IDE select Language i am using RACKET.<br>
than open file where you downloaded the repo to .<br>
Run the project<br>

## Instructions
The following exercises should be completed in the Racket programming language [1].
Remember to plan your work and make regular commits to your repository. The instructions
for submitting your work are given on the Moodle page. Note that “from scratch”
means using only cons, car, cdr, define, lambda, if, null, null?, cond, = and the
basic numerical operators (+, -, *, /, modulo). Other basic functions may be allowed,
but please confirm their use with the lecturer
