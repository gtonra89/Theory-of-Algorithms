(define (sublsum? l)
  ; Combinations is a built in racket function that returns every combination of elements in a list
  ; cdr is used to just return the 2nd element of the list pair due to the 1st element being null
  ; using filter, another racket func, to list out only the sublists that are true, in this case, sum of each sublist is equal to zero
  (filter sum (cdr (combinations l))))

; Function used to calculate sum of elements in each sublist returned from combinations
(define (sum li)
  (if (null? li) ; if list = null then..

      ; 'apply' is a racket function used to calculate the sum of elements in a list
      (equal? (apply + li) 0))) ; then check if sum is equal to 0 using 'equal' function

; Pass in the list into our function
