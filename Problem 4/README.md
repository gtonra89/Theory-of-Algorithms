Racket is a general purpose, multi-paradigm programming language in the Lisp-Scheme family. One of its design goals is to serve as a platform for language creation, design, and implementation.

## Instructions
The following exercises should be completed in the Racket programming language [1].
Remember to plan your work and make regular commits to your repository. The instructions
for submitting your work are given on the Moodle page. Note that “from scratch”
means using only cons, car, cdr, define, lambda, if, null, null?, cond, = and the
basic numerical operators (+, -, *, /, modulo). Other basic functions may be allowed,
but please confirm their use with the lecturer

## Problem 4
Write a function sublsum in Racket that takes a list (of integers) as input and returns
a list of sublists of it that sum to zero. For this problem, you can use the
combinations built-in function. Note the order of the sublists and their elements
doesn’t matter. For example:
```
> (sublsum (list 1 2 3 4 -5))
'((2 3 -5) (-5 1 4))
> (sublsum (list 1 2 3 4 5))
'()
```
